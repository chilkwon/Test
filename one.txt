VS git is not working with some authentication issue.
so, go to command line and use the below commands.

git add .
git commit -m "firs commit"
git remote add orgin git_repository_url
git push origin master

// Can upload  any your local changes to origin
git push --set-upstream origin master

// Modify any file contents
git add .
git commit -m "second commit"
git push

Then go back to your git rposotory
